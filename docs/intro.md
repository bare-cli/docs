# Bare

## What is bare? 

Bare create an empty bootstrap project for you. Create it in your own way once so you don't have to set your project anymore. You can get bootstrapes not created by other developers from GitHub. Publish your own Bare.

For eg. Sometimes `create-react-app` can't meet your needs for creating react project, it still require some change you would be comfortable with while starting your project. bare creates a boilerplate and you just add your flavours once and you can use it anytime you want!!
